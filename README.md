# Check-In
### *A Mobile+Web Suite That Lets Those You Love Know Your OK; A [Dead Man's Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man's_switch) for Your Phone*

## Getting Started
Welcome.  Our project has a working alpha version and we are neck deep in test development.  If you would like to pitch in, please review the [React Native testing overview](https://reactnative.dev/docs/testing-overview) and [our contributing guidelines](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).  We have chosen Flow for typing variables and Jest for unit/integration/component tests.  We have some time before choosing an E2E tool and are considering both suggestions in the overview.

If testing is not the right fit for you, that's OK here!  We are only slightly experienced developers motivated by the strong desire to live life and save life.  We are learning as we go and we are proud of what we are accomplishing.  We started software development with nothing but time.  Whatever level of experience you have and whatever level of income you have, we welcome you and will help you.  Just reach out to our project manager at [michaelgill1969@gmail.com](mailto:michaelgill1969@gmail.com).

## About the Project
The project is building a suite of applications for web and mobile devices, both Android and iOS, that work together as a [dead man's switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man's_switch) for your phone.  It will prompt the user to check in periodically.  By checking in, the user's buddies will know that the user is OK, or at least OK enough to check in with their phone.  If the user doesn't check in, the user's buddies will be alerted on their phone, by e-mail, by text message, and/or by phone call.  The buddy can then take appropriate action to check on their loved one.
