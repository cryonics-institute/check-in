### Your First Code Contribution

If you're new to GitHub, you can get started as follows:

1. Fork the project; it's that button on the upper right of this page; come on, go ahead, you know you want to.  :)

2. Open your Terminal and copy your fork to your local computer as follows:

    ```
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/check-in.git
   ```

   Remember to replace "USERNAME" in the URL with your username.

3. Add the main project as your upstream:

   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/cryonics-institute/check-in.git
   ```

4. Do some work;

5. Push your work back up to your fork as follows:

   ```
   git push
   ```

6. Create a pull request from your fork on GitHub by clicking that "New pull request" button towards the upper left and fill out the form.

That's a pretty brief introduction!  For a much better introduction, please see [Allen (2015)](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/).  For a good introduction to Git in general, we recommend [Chacon and Straub's (2019) *Pro Git*](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2), which is free.  The first two chapters should be more than enough.
