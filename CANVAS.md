project: Cryonics Institute Check-In App

## Product

### Problem
Cryonics stand-by patients might be alone sometimes and need a way to alert their support team.

### Solution
An app for mobile devices could remind a patient to check-in at periodic intervals.  If the patient does not check-in, and alert would be sent to family, friends, and other members of the patient's stand-by team that the patient has not checked-in and might need assistance.

### Key Metrics
Success would be measured by the following:
- App available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play;
- Number of downloads;
- Number of contributors.

### Resources Required
Contributors with knowledge of React JS are required.
